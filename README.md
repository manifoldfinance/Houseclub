Unofficial Clubhouse app for Android. Inspired by [this](https://github.com/stypr/clubhouse-py).

Not to be taken seriously.

**This app is NOT available in Google Play. The only right place to download it is here in the releases section.**

**Any issues about audio quality will be closed immediately, so please don't bother posting those.**

# FAQ
### What works?
* Login
* Registration *should* work, but I suggest that you better use an iOS device to register
* Seeing the list of rooms however the server recommends them
* Joining rooms from said list and by direct links
* Listening and speaking
* Raising hand (asking to speak)
* Accepting when a moderator allows you to speak
* Real-time updates in to the participant list
* Profiles
* Following and unfollowing people
* Followers/following lists
* Updating your "bio"
* Uploading a profile picture
* Changing your name (but the official app says you can only do this once â€” not sure if there's a limitation on the server side)
* Notifications
* People Search
* Return to active room
* Profile photo enlarge
* Phone call for getting activation code

The rest isn't implemented. In particular you can't create and moderate rooms. There's probably a hundred bugs in the existing functionality too.


### How do I build this?
Import into Android Studio and click "run". Or, there's an apk you can install in the releases section.
